It's a udemy project

It was a blog with posts and comments

But when it was time to take the deployment section project failed because of outdated tutorials for AWS and now I am not updating this because I knew it could take to much time to fix and I really wanted to start my biggest project so far which is my master thesis

Right now I will try to find some time to fix this to the stage when I can runserver or will actually deploy it on other place
